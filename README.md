# RareGPS
RareGPS is a machine learning-based score that prioritizes drug targets for uncommon and rare phecodes.

You can view RareGPS predictions interactively [here](https://rstudio-connect.hpc.mssm.edu/raregps/).

Here we provide Jupyter notebooks to:
1. Generate predictions with trained models
2. Train new models on custom phecodes
3. Demonstrate how we processed drug and genetic data for model training

Code for the EHR differential prescription analyses is available in the folder "EHR validation." We removed files containing patient information.
