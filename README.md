# RareGPS
RareGPS is a machine learning-based score that prioritizes drug targets for uncommon and rare phecodes. Here we provide Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the results of the manuscript. To run these notebooks, you must download "RareGPS_data_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz" from the [Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17689650) and extract to this directory.

You can view top RareGPS predictions interactively [here](https://rstudio-connect.hpc.mssm.edu/raregps/) and download all predictions [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17689650).
